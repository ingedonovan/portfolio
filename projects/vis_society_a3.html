        <h3> Analysis Question: Are we getting older? How have the relative proportions of age groups changed between the year 2000 and 1900? </h3>
				<p> For this assignment, I was interested in exploring how the proportions of different age groups have changed - especially in 
                    light of the constant chatter about the aging demographic pyramid. Although I had an inclination at what the answer was, I was not sure of its specific manifestation
                    across age groups. I decided to use only the data on the number of people per age group, as I was interested in the effect across genders, and was not interested in 
                    using a gender binary for my visualization, adding together the two genders provided to calculate a total sum. </p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Hand Sketches</h2>
            <p> For the first sketch, I began by sketching what I intuited would be the most "obvious" way of representing this data: a population pyramid - however, instead
                of a conventional pyramid, which represents a single year, with genders on either side, I created a comparative pyramid, which could absorb the two datasets. I 
                represented the 1900 data on the left, and the 2000 data on the right, with the age bins sorted on the y axis from youngest (top) to oldest 
            (bottom). I scaled the x axis bounds to match the maximum percentage of population for each dataset, in hope that this would amplify the distinction
            between the different bins. In retrospect, this may be misleading, as the two datasets are scaled slightly differently. </p>

            <p> I was surprised at how unsuccessful this visualization was: while it clearly shows that the 1900 population skewed younger, while the 2000 
                population skewed older, it was difficult to compare the difference between the bins for each dataset as they were on opposing sides of the 
            visualization. For the next sketch, I decided to explore a way of overlaying the data to provide a more clear comparison. </p>

            <p> For my second visualization sketch, I created a line graph by plotting the datapoints on two axes: age bins, on the x axis, and proportion of 
                population, on the y axis. This sketch succeeded in communicating the difference in population groups - it is clear that there are more younger 
                people in 1900, and more older people in 2000, and I liked how the shaded area under the line provided a feeling of a "total". However, I had some shortcomings about this sketch: the interpolation of the points seemed like it
                could potentially be an inaccurate representation of data which was provided in bins, and is therefore discontinuous. Additionally, I didn't 
                think that this was a particularly interesting data visualization - I don't think it would make me pause, since it is a very normative way to 
                show quantitative data. 
            </p>

            <p> For my final hand sketch, I decided to try and use the binned quality of the data as a design driver, and made a visualization that used small 
                multiples to show an overall trend, but also a snapshot of a condition for each age bin. I divided the 19 bins into squares, and used colour 
                to show the year, size to show the change in proportion, and added an additional element of hatching to clearly show the magnitude of the relative 
                change between 1900 and 2000. 
            </p>

					width="80%" >
			    </figure>

            <p> I found this visualization to be the most successful, because it used the qualities of the data to its advantage, and because I liked how it highlighted
                change in a very intuitive way for each age group, rather than relying on a user interpretation, as the other two did. I also found it to be a lot less normative than 
                conventional visualization of demographic information. I found that it addressed my question well, as it shows the change in age 
                group proportions in a relative manner - the size of the two blobs in the boxes is determined by the measure of how different the 2000 relative proportion
                is compared to the average of the two proportions. While this may seem complicated, I found that it was easy to follow the trend visually, and I was
                not particularly concerned with delivering precise values, but rather visualizing proportional changes. To aid with the interpretation of the area of the change markers, 
                I provided a legend that mapped area to percentage values. 
            </p>
            <p> In summary, I was surprised by the diverse ways in which I could represent this very simple, seemingly sparse data. I was also surprised that the "default" option 
                in my head was the one I liked the least, and found the least intuitive. I was most interested in representing the data in a way that seemed dynamic, instead
                of showing the demographic data of two different centuries, frozen in time.

                <h2>2. Final Design</h2>
                <p> I was interested in using what I had learned from my sketches in Part I, and therefore continuing with the same question I had initially posed: how has the 
                    relative proportion of different age groups changed when comparing the year 2000 to the year 1900? While it was tempting to bring in external data due to the sparse
                    nature of the dataset, I was interested in the challenge of creating an interesting and creative, yet legible data visualization with what was provided. 
                    My main concern was the organization of time series data in a non-linear manner: humans are accustomed to reading time on a single, linear axis, making this representation risky. 
                    After weighing the risks, I decided to proceed with the development of my third sketch.
                    I prepared the data in Excel, expressing the proportion of the average for the year 2000 in comparison to 1900, and using Grasshopper to generate the area 
                    values for the years, scaled to represent the aforementioned metric. </p>

                    <h3>a. Chart Layout</h3>
                <p> I laid out the chart bins in a 4 x 5 matrix, skipping the first box as there are 19 age group bins. The sequence of the bins is organized in a linear interrupted
                    pattern - this is an intuitive ordering for those who read in English, and as this is a class project, I assumed that this would be intuitive for viewers of the visualization. Each bin has a corresponding 
                    label below it, which help clarify the representation of each age group as a box in the matrix. While I considered adding an additional legend that explains the 
                    age labels, I decided to forego this as the numbers, when paired with the title, are relatively easy to intuit. </p>

                <h3>b. Use of Colour</h3>
                 <p> Figuring out the colours was the most challenging aspect of the design of this chart, as I initially began with four solid colours: one for each 
                    year, one for an increase, and another for a decrease in relative proportion. As I played around with my first attempts at colour, I struggled, 
                    as four colours caused significant filtering interference, and it was no longer obvious that it was being used as a key for the two years. The use of a 
                    solid block of colour made the overlaid shape, the representation of relative difference, seem like a third element, even though it was simply a subset
                    of the larger of the two proportions, cut through the center, or average of the two proportions. After a lot of experimenting, I finally realized that
                    a gradient could accomplish the same thing, without appearing like a third element. I used a gradient that faded from the average line in the center of 
                    each sub-chart, therefore becoming more intense if the shape was larger, thus quickly drawing attention to the bins with the biggest differences. 
                 </p>
                 <p> At this point, I was using the same colour gradient in both the positive, and negative direction, and I quickly realized that I was missing an opportunity
                    for redundancy gain, and therefore I decided to bring back the two additional colours. I chose two colours that are close in hue and warmth to the colours
                    of the years on top of which they are overlaid to make sure there was no filtering interference. I tried many different colour combinations, and ultimately 
                    settled on red and orange. My two reservations about these colours were (1) that they could possible imply a value judgement that I was not trying to make (ie. green = good), and (2) that they may be less perceptible for people with colour blindness. After making use of Illustrator's colour proofing
                    function, I decided that the chart was still legible without colour, and I dedided to use red and green for the intuitive connotation of reddish = reduction, 
                    and green = increase (See end for colour-proofed visualizations). I added a legend on the bottom, which I found helped signify that the gradients were an important
                    part of the visualization, and that full-saturation orange signified a negative extreme, while full-saturation green signified a positive extreme. 
                 </p>
                 
                 <h3>c. Marks and Labels</h3>
                 <p> Adhering to my theme of doing a lot with a little, I decided to forego a legend and conventional axis labels, instead using the white space in the first 
                    matrix rectangle to boldly label the two years in question, hoping that the viewer's eye would move from the title to these annotations. 
                    I added a data label to two of the gradients, hoping to anchor the quantitative assessment of the 
                    label in the perceptive, relative proportion of the shape, allowing for easier mapping onto the other gradient shapes, and onto the gradient legend. I used a dotted line to demarcate the middle of the 
                    two year fields, annotating the 30-35 age chart to function simultaneously as a label and an interpretative measure to 
                    confirm the reader's understanding of an equally divided chart with no gradient symbolizing an equal proportion between the two years. I added one further 
                    interpretative label for redundancy, and to add a narrative dimension to the chart. 
                 </p>
