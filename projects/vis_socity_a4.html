	<main>
        <p> I began this assignment by exploring the IMF Climate Dataset. This dataset is vast, and extremely comprehensive, so I quickly decided that I wanted to 
            look at my home country, Canada - after 3 years of doing research motivated by climate change, but often dominated by data about the United States and Europe, 
        I was keen to learn more about Canada's progress. I quickly honed in on data related to fossil fuel production, as Canada's economy is primarily supported by oil 
    production, both offshore and in the Alberta tar sands. This is an extremely divisive topic that is often politicized, so I thought it fit the theme of the assignment well. </p>

    <p> Exploring the dataset, I found excellent data on the production of oil, the change in environmental taxes, and most importantly, government subsidies of fossil fuels. The data 
        roughly followed my preconceived notions: even though the Liberal party, which is ostensibly progressive on climate issues, has been in power for 9 years, Canada continues
    to invest in fossil fuels. </p>

    <h3> Proposition: Despite promises, Canada continues to invest in the production of fossil fuels. </h3>

        <h2>
            Design Decisions and Rationale
        </h2>

        <h3>Visualization 1</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Using bold, suggestive colours, and emphasizing volume</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: 1.5 [earnest] </p>
                <p> I chose to use bold, suggestive colours to correlate the black area of the graph with a total amount of emissions, using black to emphasize
                    the negative nature of greenhouse gas emissions, and use red to show total oil production, emphasizing that oil production should be considered negative. For the 
                    government subsidy chart on the bottom left, I used green to signify downward-trending environmental taxes, which I wanted the viewer to perceive as a positive measure, 
                    while using red to signify government subsidy into fossil fuels, which were trending upwards. For the pie chart, I also used black, to emphasize how the energy 
                industry dominates emissions in Canada. </thead> </p>
            <li><b> Overlaying data</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: 2 [fully earnest] </p>
                <p> For two of the charts, I overlaid multiple datasets - in the first case, emissions and production data, and in the second, subsidy and environmental 
                    tax data. In the case of the first chart, I was hoping to show that while the government was making promises, emissions were rising, and production was still
                    increasing significantly. I think this is a totally earnest strategy, as it helps viewers find correlations without them being explicitly called out. 
                </p>
            <li><b> Using a bi-axial chart</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: -1 [mostly deceptive] </p>
                <p> For the subsidy chart, I decided to plot two lines on one chart: environmental taxes, and explicit government subsidies for fossil fuels. Although the two axes 
                    have the same units (% of GDP), they are on different points on the scale. To exaggerate the divergence of the two trends (disinvestment in environmental issues, investment in fossil fuels), 
                    I made the two lines overlap, which is deceptive as I have no evidence that the two datasets are related. 
                </p>
            <li><b>Excluding certain data</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: -0.5 [slightly deceptive] </p>
                <p> For the government subsidy sub-chart (bottom left), I excluded the year 2022, during which subsidies trended slightly downwards. I did this because
                    the data for environmental taxes ended in 2021, and I felt that it would have been strange to end one line early. Even though I felt that I had a just
                    cause for clipping the x axis, I think if it hadn't been in my favour, I might have thought twice about it. 
                </p>
            <li><b>Narrative annotations</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: 1.5 [earnest] </p>
                <p>To make the visualizations more persuasive, I used annotation to link the data to specific policy moments that may be memorable, or surprising, to viewers. 
                    I wanted to emphasize how investment in fossil fuels, and resultant emissions, continued to climb, despite the promises that have been made by the Canadian government.
                    I think this is almost a fully earnest tactic, as long as it doesn't obscure the legibility of the visualization. I also used the motif of a drip to mark narrative annotations,
                    hoping to invoke the feeling of flowing oil, or pollution. 
                </p>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Visualization 2</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Using muted, suggestive colors</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: -1 [slightly deceptive] </p>
                <p>For the second visualization, which argued that Canada was divesting from fossil fuels, I decided to use muted green tones to create a calm, greenwashed atmosphere. For the main visualization
                    I used a blue to green gradient to attempt to show that the trend was becoming "greener." Overall, I wanted this to be a deceptive decision, as 
                    I believe the colour green has no business being used in visualizations that represent fossil fuels, as most people equate it with "positive."
                </p>
            <li><b>Switching measure on y axis</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: -2 [fully deceptive] </p>
                <p>The main deceptive decision I made for the second visualization was to switch the metric on the y axis from metric tons of CO2 equivalent to metric tons of CO2 equivalent per million USD 
                    of output. This transformation immediately made the graph trend downwards, making it appear as if emissions were being reduced, when in reality, this was being normalized
                    by output, and thus only representing improvements in production processes. I increased the deceptiveness by also decreasing the font of the label on the y axis in addition to 
                    orienting it vertically, which made it more difficult to read. 
                </p>
            <li><b>Using arrows to suggest future trends</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: -0.5 [slightly deceptive] </p>
                <p>In this visualization, I also used arrows to attempt to guide the viewer to a certain conclusion. For the subsidy and emissions chart, I attached an 
                    arrowhead to the end of the line, hoping to make it seem like the graph indicated a future trend. I think this is a deceptive decision, as my graph 
                    was not performing a trend analysis, and as certain numbers one year do not determine the vales for future years. I also think arrows encourage lazy reading
                    of charts, especially in ones as sparse, and simple as the ones I'm showing. 
                </p>
            <li><b>Difficult to measure, unnecessary comparisons</b></li>
                <p style="color: red"> Level of deceptiveness: -1.5 [mostly deceptive] </p>
                <p> For the last sub-visualization on the right, I nested circles whose areas corresponded to the total government subsidies for fossil fuels. I 
                    deliberately chose three countries with oil-based economies and a strong record for government investment in oil as a comparison, using the 
                    scaling effects of area comparisons to make it seem like the Canadian government's subsidization of fossil fuels is very small. I did not include 
                    any countries who subsidize less (of which there are a considerable amount). 
                </p>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Both Visualizations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cherry-picking data</b></li>
            <figure>
                <img src="images\header.png" alt="Global fossil fuel subsidies are nowhere near 7 trillion a year. They're 1.3 trillion. (Read the fine print)"
                    width="75%" >
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images\header2.png" alt="Flawed fossil fuel 'subsidy' math"
                        width="60%" >
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images\header3.png" alt="Energy subsidy shenanigans: the green IMF at work"
                            width="60%" >
                        </figure>
            <p>I wanted to include a separate point on cherry-picking data, as the data I used to represent government subsidies varied across the two visualizations, and as I'm 
                not sure which decision is more deceptive, or if either of them were deceptive at all.
                For visualization one, which I intended to be mostly earnest, I used <b>explicit</b> government subsidies, which denote money spent by the government to 
                bring the retail price of a commodity below the production cost. For the second visualization, I used aggregated data on explicit and <b>implicit</b> subsidies, 
                which turn out to be a very contentious metric - they include climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, local health damages (primarily pre-mature deaths), 
                and traffic congestion and accident externalities associated with the use of road fuels. As the visualization shows, these are much higher than implicit subsidies. 
                A bit of research showed that many voices online (especially conservative, business-oriented outlets such as Bloomberg and Forbes) consider the idea of implicit
                subsidies to be deceptive, and poorly understood - therefore while Visualization 2 was perhaps more earnest in its inclusion of more data, my intuition was that 
                Visualization 1 was perhaps more honest as it only included explicit government spending, which is difficult to argue with. 
            </p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
        <p>This was a very interesting assignment, as I went in with preconceived notions that were admittedly destabilized, and as I made deceptive decisions for both visualizations in 
            order to make them more persuasive. I realized how easy it was to rationalize excluding certain data, or using certain design techniques, especially if I am aligned with a 
            certain view on the subject. For the visualization that I intended to be mostly earnest, I was surprised to find myself still making deceptive decisions - especially when I chose 
            to clip the x axis for the subsidization chart. Even though this was the point of the assignment, I was deliberately seeking out data that confirmed my hypothesis, while
            ignoring data that may complicate it. On the topic of ethical visualization, I certainly had a gut feeling when I was doing something deceptive, but I think 
            this feeling would not have occurred if I wasn't interrogating my motivations along the way. This certainly does not always happen in practice, and it makes me reflect on last 
            week's reading - perhaps it would actually be a helpful activity to interrogate your own motivations prior to the creation of a visualization, even if they may seem obvious to you, since
            the act of doing so encourages reflective behaviour. 
        </p>
        <p> I think the fact that both of these visualizations were intended to be persuasive makes things murkier ethically: many of the techniques I used would be extremely inappropriate for 
            more objective, scientific visualizations, but seem commonplace in data visualizations about political or social topics. I think this exercise has made me slightly wearier of annotations 
            such as arrows, or what others may call "chart junk" - while it may seem helpful for guiding the viewer, I found it very easy to add annotations that crossed into the realm of deceptiveness. 
            I think there are two categories of visualizations that should adhere to stronger codes of ethics: those that deal with politically contentious topics (such as the ones from this assignment), 
            and those that are deeply scientific. I think any charts in these two categories should be subject to increased scrutiny, with careful consideration about colour, narration, annotation, and 
            data inclusion/exclusion. I think most other visualizations can benefit from the persuasive techniques we have been learning about: perhaps by guiding the viewer, or by communicating intensity
            or urgency through design choices.
