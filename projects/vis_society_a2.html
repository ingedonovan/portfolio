			<h2>Subtheme: [Condo Conversions]</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions:</h3>
			<h3> Do condo conversions happen more rapidly in neighbourhoods with fast-rising real estate values? </h3>
				<p>I'm motivated to learn more about this as I was recently reading about gentrification in Chicago, and I'm curious about how certain trends turn into positive
					feedback loops. </p>
				<h3>
				What type of properties are most likely to become condos - historic, or recently built? </h3>
				<p>My background is in architecture and building technology, so therefore I'm interested in finding patterns in types of constructive system or certain typologies of building. 
				</p>
				<h3>How does the condo conversion affect the property - does it become more valuable? Is this reflected 
					only in the financial value assessment of the property, or are there other markers? </h3>
				<p>I'm curious about whether the conversion of a property
					into a set of condos is primarily a symbolic/bureaucratic move, or whether there are more tangible changes as well. </p>

			<h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

			</figure>

			<p> I decided to look at both Boston and Cambridge to get an understanding of the similarities and differences of the two datasets. 
				My first investigation was to compare the size of the two datasets - I found that the Cambridge dataset was considerably smaller than the Boston dataset (Figure 1). 
				This makes sense, since Cambridge is a smaller city. 
			</p>

				Figure 3 - Bar chart illustrating null and zero data for the Cambridge condo conversion dataset. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p> Next, I was interested in understanding the completeness of each dataset, as a first glance at the csv file showed many zero and null values. Before arbitrarily
				removing these from my visualizatons, I wanted to understand whether a null or zero value had meaning in the context of the data. For example, a null or zero value 
				for a "parking" field could mean that there is no parking, or that there is no data.  
			</p>

			<p> The completeness of the data ranged from 10% to 100% - again, with the caveat that a 10% value could include zero fields that are actually meaningful. To fully decipher the meaning
				of a null or zero value, one would need to look at every column in the dataset - visualization can help with this. This is why I 
				separated this visualization into two separate columns, one indicating null values, and one indicating zero values (Figure 2-3). I found that zero values sometimes stood in for 
				null values, making the cleaning of this data more complicated - for example, there are many zero values for "land value post" - this seems unrealistic. I also found that there was significant data incompleteness, especially for important data like 
				the sale price of buildings or condos after conversion.

				Figure 5 - Histogram showing condo conversions in Cambridge by year (2015-2023)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>Next, I was interested in the date range of the data, and understanding whether condo conversions were increasing or decreasing. 
				I noticed that in Boston, condo conversions peaked in 2023, while in Cambridge, conversions have been increasing since 2016 (Fig 4 and 5). Both Boston and Cambridge
				have a gap in data from 2017, and a seemingly disproportional number of conversions in 2018, so it seems that the 2017 data may have been mislabelled as 2018 data. I suspect
				that it is not possible to deduce which data is mislabelled, and which isn't.

				<figcaption>
				Fig 7 - Bubble diagram showing distribution of building types in Cambridge prior to condo conversion.

			</figure>

			<p> I saw an opportunity to address my third question, which was about what kind of buildings are most likely to be converted into condos. 
				In both Cambridge and Boston, condo conversions primarily targeted single, two-family and three-family apartments (Fig 6 and 7).
				In Boston, the largest category is "residential condo." 
				It is unclear to me what a "residential condo" is - perhaps this is a misclassification?

				<figcaption>
				Fig 8 - Boston: Year of construction for original building before conversion.  
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p> Next, I addressed my third question more directly - were mostly older buildings targeted, or were newer buildings desirable? I created a plot of 
				the count of buildings for each construction year for Boston, as this data is not available for Cambridge (Fig 8). Here, I encountered a new issue - there were a seemingly disproportional number of buildings
				dated to 1880, 1890, 1900, 1910 - likely because the construction date wasn't known, and the entry was estimated or rounded. I realized that a histogram would 
				be a better visualization, so I made this as well (Fig 9). The histogram shows a clear trend toward the conversion of buildings around 100 years old - since these are 
				mostly single family units, is it possible that they are primarily in areas with higher pressure on the housing market?
				There was also an increase of condo conversions around the turn of the century - is it possible that buildings are being built with the intent for rapid conversion into condos?

				<figcaption>
				Fig 10 - Boston: Condo conversions by original building age and land use prior to conversion.   
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p> When I plotted land use over building age, I did not immediately notice any new trends (Fig 10). However, this visualization clearly showed that the upticks from 
				Figure 8 were due to the conversion of single family homes with less than 4 units.

				<img src="images\Boston Building Value.png" alt=""
				width= "100%">>
				<figcaption>
				Figure 11 - Histogram showing distribution of condo conversions in Boston by building value prior to conversion, not including buildings valued higher than 8 million USD.

				<figcaption>
					Figure 12 - Histogram showing distribution of condo conversions in Cambridge by building value prior to conversion, not including buildings valued higher than 7.2 million USD. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Next, to gain insight on my first question, I address the value of the buildings being converted. 
				In both Cambridge and Boston, houses valued at less than 2 million USD were most likely to be converted into condos (Fig 11 and 12). However, there were notable outliers - for example Park 1st
				St. in Cambridge, which was valued at over $100 million USD prior to conversion, and 100 Huntington Ave. in Boston, valued at over $300 million USD. 
				These are not shown on the histogram as they are outliers. For these, and all following visualization data on building or land value, I kept zero values, as it is possible
				for buildings or land to have a negative value - however it is likely that some of these zero values are either erroneous, or signfiy a null value. 
			</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				I continued my exploration of the first question. Intuitively, I thought that there were probably specific areas that were more amenable, or more desirable, for condo conversions. Using ZIP code and 
				building value prior to condo conversion data, I mapped the dataset (Figure 13 and 14). Interestingly, the most "lucrative" areas around downtown Boston with the highest average building prices prior to conversion
				have less overall projects, and quickly gentrifying neighbourhoods such as Roxbury and East Boston have a higher count of total conversions. 
				Naturally, I was interested in the change in value of the building post condo
				conversion, however the data was extremely spotty for this field, including over 1600 zero values, which made it difficult to compute a median or average value (Figure 15, see Figure 2). 
			</p>

				<figcaption>
				Figure 17 - Histogram showing distribution of number of units for condo conversions in Cambridge. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p> Condo conversions in both Cambridge and Boston skew toward a lower number of units, however Boston has more conversions with a larger number
				of units. For both datasets, there are a few fields with very large values (ie. 56 in Cambridge, and 200+ in Boston). However, these values 
				seem plausible, therefore I think they should be kept (Fig 16 and 17).

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p> To wrap up my exploration of value, I did a last analysis on the correlation between the assessed value of the parcel and the area of the parcel. 
				Both visualizations show a correlation between the area and value of the parcel, which is unsurprising, and figure 19 indicates that larger parcels are more likely 
				to be converted into more condos - however a large parcel does not necessarily mean more condos. For the scatterplot, I initially cropped out any outliers, but eventually
				decided on a logarithmic scale axis for both parcel area and parcel value to improve the visualization.

				<figcaption>
				Figure 21 - Boston - Building condition post condo conversion.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
	
			<p> Finally, I was curious to explore how the conversion into condos changed the condition of the property, as I addressed in my last question. 
				Although I'm not sure how these condition assessments are performed, and if there is unique data for the "prior" and "post" field, my assumption
				was that there would be a substantial improvement in building condition - however I was proven wrong, as there was only a barely perceptible overal improvement, 
				with more null values (grey) for the condition post conversion, casting doubt on the usefulness of this data (Fig 20 and 21).

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>This data exploration was really rewarding and informative, however also left me with more questions than answers, particularly for some of the fields with sparse
				data. Most of these questions are about the assessed value of the land or building post conversion, or the sale price of the individual condos - I felt like I was unable 
				to fully address my third question, which was partially concerned with the change in value as apartments are converted into condominiums. The most interesting 
				results were the spatialized results, as it was easy to begin to notice patterns that correlate to my understanding of Boston, having lived in the city for four years. I 
				also found that the given data was helpful to answer my second question, which was about the physical attributes of the building stock that is being converted. Im curious
				to investigate the different time spans involved in condo conversion more, especially the duration for which these properties are held before being converted, which 
				was something that was difficult to determine given the gaps in this data. 
			</p>
			<p>My biggest takeaway was probably about the usefulness of the visualization of the data completeness (Figure 2 and 3). Initially, I found it very hard to navigate the data, 
				and after I made those two figures I continuously returned back to them to determine what data was "high quality" and what results were more questionable. I think this ties 
				in well with the "exploratory" phase of data analysis that has been covered in class - something I don't usually do when working with a given dataset.
